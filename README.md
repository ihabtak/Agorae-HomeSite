# Agorae-Homesite

Agorae-Map21 is a generic knowledge map. It feeds on a continuous collaboration between/with multiple organizations, to map the issue of transitions in an approach that is as wide and exhaustive as possible. Based on this large-scale research perimeter, Map-21 aims at showing the transition problems felt inside organizations as well as on the outside, on a larger societal scale. As an organization does not function on its own, this generic approach combining diverse points of view is essential to allow better dialogue between the internal perspective of the organization on one hand and the perspective of its partners or other actors in its surroundings on the other hand.
